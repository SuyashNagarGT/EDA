# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining, summarizing, and visualizing a dataset to uncover its key characteristics—like structure, patterns, and anomalies—before diving into formal modeling or drawing conclusions.

🌈 Before you jump into the cool stuff like machine learning and prediction... EDA is your “get-to-know-you” phase with the data.
You explore, poke around, and make friends with the numbers 👀📊—so you don’t end up modeling with messy, mysterious, or misleading info.


🧠 Key reasons it’s important:
- Know your data: You find out what’s inside—like number of features, missing values, or weird entries.
- Spot problems early: Catch outliers, incorrect formats, or inconsistent categories.
- Guide decisions: Helps you decide which features are useful, whether to clean or transform data, and how to model it.
- Reveal insights: Simple plots and stats can uncover patterns—like which products sell more during weekends or which age group spends more online.
